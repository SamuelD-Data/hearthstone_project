# Hearthstone Project

# About this Project

This project will focus on exploring cards that within the standard format of Hearthstone as of February 2021. 

# Goals

- Thoroughly prepare so that it is ready for exploration and modeling
    - I won't be creating any models for this project but I'd still like to prepare the data nonetheless
- Explore the data to gather insights about the characteristics of the game's different class types

# Note

This project is currently a work in progress.
